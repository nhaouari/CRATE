<i>Keywords: distributed, decentralized, collaborative, real-time editor,
network of browsers</i>

CRATE is a real-time distributed and decentralized CollaboRATive Editor running
directly in web browsers.

# Try it out
The [online demo](http://nhaouari.github.io/CRATE/) is available. First, make
sure your browser is [WebRTC
compatible](http://caniuse.com/#feat=rtcpeerconnection).


# Features
## CRATEv1 
CRATEv1 aims to enable collaborative editing anywhere, at any time, whatever the number of participants, without a third party. Compared to Google Docs, (i) CRATE
does not limit the number of simultaneous users, (ii) CRATE does not rely on
service providers, thus your documents belong to you and whom you trust, (iii) CRATE does not include all text editing capabilities.

## CRATEv2 
**CRATEv2**  is in the goal of making CRATE  more user-friendly with enhanced formatting options. CRATEv2 add capabilities of modern collaborative editors using **QUILL** editor. Therefore, all the basic text formatting options are now supported. Moreover, the images from the web via copy past or directly from user to user (small sizes < 25Kb). The equations are supported also using KaTeX. Beside this, a basic commenting system is added to the editor, to support more interaction between the editors ([online demo](http://nhaouari.github.io/CRATE/)).



> **CRATEv2** is still in its very early stage of development. Therefore, the
application may be buggy. Also, even basic functionalities are not implemented
yet. Feel free to [request functionalities, report issues, and ask
questions](https://github.com/nhaouari/CRATE/issues).
